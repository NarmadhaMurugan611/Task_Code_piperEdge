I have completed the task using front end Technologies name called React js.



###for fetch the data i have used json link that you have provided


### https://piperedge.com/screening-test/assets/json/products.json

I have used the above json link i have converted into an api called http://localhost:3001/api/products...
To convert the api to rectify the cors error i have used node.js to convert it into a normal local api.

As per the requirement i have finished the interview test code.
